# Chinese-to-English-Model-using-Mt5
A litte project I made that translates english to chinese and visa vera using the text-to-text mt5 transformer. I also used streamlit as the frontend for the website. 
The model would probably need more training, here is the kaggle notebook I made and use for training: https://www.kaggle.com/code/ponderpiece/building-a-en-zh-model-using-mt5
